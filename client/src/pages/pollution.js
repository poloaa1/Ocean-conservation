      About 14 billion pounds of garbage are dumped in the ocean every year. Pollution is a problem that directly affects life in the ocean and the natural balance. It affects our health and resources also. Oil spills, toxic wastes and the dumping of other materials all contribute to ocean pollution. Because oceans cover over 70% of our planet, water sources are the perfect carriers of pollution. This allows pollution to spread rapidly and to go all over the world through ocean currents and connected water ways. Lawful ocean dumping of various pollutants was once common practice, but is now regulated. However, the wastes that were dumped into the ocean over a century ago remain there still. Human wastes, ground-up garbage, water from bathing, and plastics all contribute to ocean dumping and are contaminating our food supply. Plastic shopping bags have been known to find their way into animals blocking their digestive tracts and causing them to die. Plastic six-pack rings choke various animals and other waste is mistaken by animals for food. Any unnatural trash can be harmful to ocean life.

      Garbage patches are large areas of the ocean where trash and other marine debris collects. These areas are made up of debris ranging in size from microplastics to large bundles of derelict fishing gear. These patches are formed by large rotating ocean currents. There are five main patches in the ocean: one in the Indian Ocean, two in the Atlantic Ocean, and two in the Pacific Ocean. Due to winds and currents, garbage patches are constantly changing size and shape. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is the largest of them. It is estimated that the patch covers 1.6 million square kilometers and is actually the combination of the â€œEastern Garbage Patch" and the "Western Garbage Patch". The debris making up the garbage patches can be found from the surface of the ocean all the way to the ocean floor.

      Heavy metals contaminants (like mercury, chromium, and aluminum) can accumulate in sea life, making it harmful for humans to consume. Microplastics can be ingested by fish and other species that filter their food out of the water. For many years, scientists have known that chemicals will move up the food chain as predators absorb the chemicals consumed by their prey. That's why the fish like tuna and swordfish tend to have the highest levels of mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other dioxins. Scientists are also concerned about another kind of water pollution: chemicals from prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications that make their way to the ocean and get ingested by marine animals. Many people all over the world eat fish and fish all over the world eat plastics and other chemicals. Eating fish containing chemical pollutants may cause birth defects, liver damage, cancer, and other serious health problems.
