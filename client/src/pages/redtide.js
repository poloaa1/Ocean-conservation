                  You may be wondering "what is red tide"? Red tide is a more common term for "Harmful algal blooms" or HABs. When simple plants that live in the sea or fresh water, called algae, grow out of control they create large blooms. These algal blooms turn the water red, reduce oxygen, and give off toxic fumes. HABs are harmful to creatures and plants living in the water as well as humans. HABs not only kill life under the water, but make anything caught in these areas inedible, especially shellfish. Not all algal blooms are harmful. Most blooms have benefits. The tiny creatures supply food for life in the ocean. They are the greatest source of energy that fuels the oceans food chain. Some species of algae, however, can be toxic when they form large blooms. Alexandrium fundyense, alexandrium catenella and karenia brevis are common species of toxic algae in North America. </p>

            HABs are caused by microscopic algae that produce toxins that kill fish and make shellfish dangerous to eat. They happen naturally out at sea but as the get closer to the coast they intensify and become extremely harmful to humans and other animals. Runoff from sewage, agriculture, air pollution and human interference with the natural flow on rivers have a major effect on the growth of HABs. They introduce nutrients into the ocean
