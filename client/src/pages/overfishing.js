      Fishing is one of the most significant drivers of declines in ocean wildlife populations. Catching fish is not inherently bad for the ocean, except for when vessels catch fish faster than stocks can replenish, something called overfishing. The number of overfished stocks globally has tripled in half a century and today fully one-third of the world's assessed fisheries are currently pushed beyond their biological limits, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Overfishing is closely tied to bycatch—the capture of unwanted sea life while fishing for a different species. This, too, is a serious marine threat that causes the needless loss of billions of fish, along with hundreds of thousands of sea turtles and cetaceans. The damage done by overfishing goes beyond the marine environment. Billions of people rely on fish for protein, and fishing is the principal livelihood for millions of people around the world.

      In fishing, money is a strong motivator that can incentivize people to improve practices and fund the management necessary to reduce fishing’s footprint on the natural world. But spending money in the wrong ways can also exacerbate the consequences of overfishing. As much as $20 billion is spent globally by governments every year to offset the cost of expenses such as fuel, fishing gear, and building new vessels. Oftentimes these pay-outs are harmful to the environment, supporting too many boats fishing too hard on already stressed stocks. They also prop up large fleets and companies, including huge distant water fleets, at the expense of local communities dependent on fishing for survival. Some of those billions handed out every year even find their way to illegal operators, compounding the harm to fishers who follow the rules. Illicit operations are often associated with transnational crimes such as tax fraud, drug and human trafficking and slavery at sea, posing an increasing security risk to the world. A few years ago, the World Trade Organization (WTO) set a goal to adopt an agreement on ending harmful subsidies in the fishing sector by 2020. It’s an important target that our planet can’t afford to miss.
